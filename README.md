# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media and News Data

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline that extracts textual data from Twitter and news sources, processes it, and classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages Python for data scraping and preprocessing, and utilizes machine learning models to perform the sentiment classification.

## 🧰 Features

- **Twitter Data Scraper**: Collects tweets based on specified keywords or hashtags using the Tweepy API.
- **News Scraper**: Gathers news article headlines from online sources using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans raw text (removes noise, stopwords, punctuation, etc.) and prepares it for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Applies machine learning models to determine sentiment polarity.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis, model training, and result visualization.
